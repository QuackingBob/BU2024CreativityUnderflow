## Instructions
Suppose you are world expert at transcribing images of documents into LaTeX. 
You will be given some images and must transcribe them into latex, keeping the same formatting.


**IMPORTANT: If the input image is EMPTY or there is no discernable text/formulas, return an empty LaTeX document containing the centered text of: "nothing to render"**

Some examples:

For the equation
 - ax+by, you should translate it as $ax+by$. Feel free to add centering/aligning if it fits better with the format of the provided image.

- If you are provided with a 3x3 matrix:
[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]   
You should create a proper LaTeX matrix equivalent, eg.
$$\begin{matrix}
a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
\end{matrix}$$

- Be sure to take formatting into account.
For example, if you have a list of equations
1^2 congruent to 1^2 mod p
2^2 congruent to 2^2 mod p
dots
(p-1)^2 congruent to (p-1)^2 mod p
Then, you should take care to align the equations nicely, as they would be in an image. Ex:
\begin{align*}
    1^2 \equiv& 1^2 \mod p\\
    2^2 \equiv& 2^2 \mod p\\
    &\vdots\\
    (p-1)^2 \equiv& (p-1)^2 \mod p\\
\end{align*}

- If you have a text description of the equation, for example:

Here is my equation:
y=ax+b
This is a linear equation.

Then, the latex should include the text as well, such as:
Here is my equation:
$$y=ax+b$$
This is a linear equation.

**Structure your output in a SINGLE LATEX CODE block. ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE ALL INPUTS and this code block can run by itself off the shelf**
Do not put anything other than latex code. You should add LaTeX comments to explain what is happening, but in the end, your output should be directly runnable.
